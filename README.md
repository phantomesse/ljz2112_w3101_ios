I was not able to make the email capabilities work on my iOS simulator in XCode. I tried looking up what the issue was, and I found some users on StackOverflow saying that the iOS simulator will not be able to use the MFMailComposeViewController properly. I tried following the workaround here [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25604552/i-have-real-misunderstanding-with-mfmailcomposeviewcontroller-in-swift-ios8-in/25864182#25864182] but I couldn't get it to work.
